Great question! Let me **clearly explain** what this `LUGGAGE_PAGE_FLOW` structure is and how you can define a new one.

---

### ✅ **What is `LUGGAGE_PAGE_FLOW`?**

It is essentially an **array of page flow definitions** for your luggage locker PWA app.
Each object in the array defines:

1. **A Page/Screen** (`name` and `path`)
2. **Where a user can go next from that page** (`exitPages` array)

This allows you to manage the navigation logic **declaratively**, likely for purposes like:

* Controlling allowed navigation paths
* Dynamically rendering screens
* Preventing invalid flows
* Centralizing all routing logic in one place

---

### ✅ **Example Breakdown**

```js
{
  "name": "home",
  "path": "/home-screen",
  "exitPages": [
    {
      "key": "lockerOpened",
      "name": "lockerOpened",
      "path": "/locker-opened"
    },
    {
      "key": "lockerSizeSelection",
      "name": "lockerSizeSelection",
      "path": "/locker-size"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

This means:

* You are currently on **Home Screen** (`/home-screen`)
* From here, user is allowed to navigate to:

  * Locker Opened page (`/locker-opened`)
  * Locker Size Selection (`/locker-size`)
  * Swipe to Open Locker (`/swipe-to-open`)
  * Menu Drawer (`/custom-drawer`)

### ✅ **How to Define a New One**

To add a new page to this flow, simply add a new object to the array with:

| Field       | Meaning                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `name`      | Internal name of the page                  |
| `path`      | URL path for that page                     |
| `exitPages` | Array of allowed next pages from this page |

---

### ✅ **Example: Adding a New Page**

Suppose you want to add a **"Locker History"** page.

```js
{
  "name": "lockerHistory",
  "path": "/locker-history",
  "exitPages": [
    {
      "key": "home",
      "name": "home",
      "path": "/home-screen"
    }
  ]
}
```

Now, add an exit option to `home` page to allow going to locker history:

```js
{
  "name": "home",
  "path": "/home-screen",
  "exitPages": [
    {
      "key": "lockerOpened",
      "name": "lockerOpened",
      "path": "/locker-opened"
    },
    {
      "key": "lockerSizeSelection",
      "name": "lockerSizeSelection",
      "path": "/locker-size"
    },
    {
      "key": "lockerHistory",
      "name": "lockerHistory",
      "path": "/locker-history"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

### ✅ **Summary**

✔ Central place to control navigation paths
✔ Prevents random, untracked navigation
✔ Easy to add new screens by defining new objects
✔ `exitPages` define what routes are allowed from that page

### ✅ **Let me know**

If you want, I can help you draft the exact JSON structure for any specific new page you are planning.

Want me to? Just tell me the **page name** and **where you want to allow navigation from/to**.
