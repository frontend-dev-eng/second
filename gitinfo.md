Yes, âœ… it's absolutely possible to allow **multiple GitHub users to push code to different repositories from the same system**, but you need to configure Git properly to avoid conflicts.

## âœ… **3 Reliable Ways to Handle Multiple GitHub Accounts on One System**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Method 1: Use SSH Keys (Recommended for most cases)**

You generate separate SSH keys for each GitHub account and tell Git which key to use based on the repository.

#### âœ… Steps:

1. Generate SSH key for each account:

```bash
# For Personal Account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_personal_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# For Work Account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_work_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

2. Add both SSH keys to your **GitHub** accounts.

3. Edit `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
# Personal GitHub
Host github-personal
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal

# Work GitHub
Host github-work
   HostName github.com
   User git
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
```

4. Clone repos like this:

```bash
# Personal repo
git clone git@github-personal:username/repo.git

# Work repo
git clone git@github-work:organization/repo.git
```

âœ… This ensures Git uses the right credentials for each repo.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Method 2: Use HTTPS with Different Credentials (with Token Prompt)**

If you use HTTPS URLs, Git will ask for credentials or Personal Access Token (PAT) when pushing.

#### âœ… You can:

* Use **Git Credential Manager** to store separate credentials.
* Or clear cached credentials between pushes (`Credential Manager` on Windows).

But this method is slightly more manual and error-prone.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Method 3: Git Config Per Repository**

Inside each repo, you can set a different username/email:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Work Username"
git config user.email "your_work_email@example.com"
```

And for personal repo:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Personal Username"
git config user.email "your_personal_email@example.com"
```

This controls the author info in commits but does not control authentication. Combine with SSH or HTTPS for full control.

| Method              | Best For                           | Notes                                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH Keys            | Cleanly managing multiple accounts | Recommended, requires initial setup                 |
| HTTPS with Tokens   | Occasional repo switching          | Easier for beginners but may need frequent re-login |
| Git Config per Repo | Separating commit author info      | Combine with SSH or HTTPS for full separation       |
